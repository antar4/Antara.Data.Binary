General purpose high performance binary serialization library

:warning: I'm still uploading documentation. Will be complete in a few days. Sorry for the inconvenience



## Overview

Antara.Data.Binary is a high performance general purpose binary serialization library. It produces a dense byte array in the easiest way and is flexible enough to cover most cases.



## Features

* High level of control
* Easy to use
* Really easy to use
* It is fast



## Why ADB?

While other libraries provide easier ways to serialize your data, by using attributes, automatic serialization of collections and nested types and others, ADB allows you really low level control over how the serialization happens in the simplest of manners. 

Benchmarking ADB versus most of the libraries with the datasets they provide, you will find ADB to be slower. That is because the data used for the benchmark are generic data that would most likely be a great fit for JSON, or dotNet xml.

ADB is great for game data, financial data and mostly data that do not contain a lot of text. These are the cases where ADB shines and outperforms in speed and size all other libraries.
